🐍 Snake Game
A fun and simple Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🎮 This project is a modern take on the classic Snake Game, featuring intuitive controls, dynamic gameplay, and persistent score storage using localStorage.

🚀 Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake using the WASD keys or arrow keys.
Food Generation: The snake grows longer each time it consumes food, which appears randomly on the game board.
Collision Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you play. Your highest scores are saved even after refreshing the browser thanks to localStorage.
Responsive UI: The game board and UI elements are responsive and styled using CSS for an enjoyable user experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the game elements.
CSS3: For styling the game, including gradients and 3D effects for the snake's head.
JavaScript (ES6): For game logic, rendering, and user interactions.
localStorage: Used to persist scores between browser sessions.


📋 How It Works
Game Logic:
The snake moves in the specified direction, controlled via the keyboard.
Every time the snake eats the randomly positioned food, it grows in size and the score increments.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game board.

Score Storage:
Scores are stored in the browser’s localStorage, allowing the leaderboard to persist across page reloads.
The highest scores are displayed in a descending order after each game.

🎮 How to Play
Use the WASD keys or Arrow keys to move the snake.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake’s body.
Eat the red food to grow and increase your score.
Try to achieve the highest score possible!
